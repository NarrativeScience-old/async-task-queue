## Installation

async-task-queue requires Python 3.6 or above.

```bash
pip install async-task-queue
```

## Guide

```python
import logging
from async_task_queue import AsyncTask, AsyncTaskQueue

# Initialize a logger
logger = logging.getLogger("foo")

# Initialize an AsyncTaskQueue where:
#   - At most 5 tasks are running concurrently
#   - Number of tasks executing concurrently should be limited by a semaphore
#   - Failed tasks should be retried (default behavior)
#   - Executing the tasks queued should timeout and be cancelled after 5 minutes
task_queue = AsyncTaskQueue(
    logger,
    use_semaphore=True,
    batch_size=5,
    execution_timeout=300
)

# Add async tasks to the queue
task_queue.enqueue(
    [
        AsyncTask(some_coroutine, *args, **kwargs) for args, kwargs in some_args_kwargs
    ]
)

# Start processing the queue
await task_queue.execute()
```
